# User Story

I want to view the weather forecast for several cities as a traveller so that I may prepare for my trip appropriately.

# Acceptance Criteria

A WEATHER DISPLAY WITH FORM ENTRIES IS PROVIDED
I am given information about the present and future state of a city when I search for it, and the city is also added to my search history.
When I see the current weather in that city, I see the name of the city, the date, an icon for the current weather, along with the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
When I view the UV index, a colour indicating whether the conditions are favourable, moderate, or severe is then shown to me.
When I view the forecast for that city, I am then given a 5-day forecast that shows the date, a representation of the weather in the form of a symbol, the temperature, the humidity and actual sunrise time.
